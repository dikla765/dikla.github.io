## Publications

### IoT-Based Monitoring and Control System for Improving Water Quality in Aquaponics using Random Forest Algorithm
- **Authors**: Lucien Dikla Ngueleo (a), Justin Moskolaï Ngossaha (a), Raymond Houé Ngouna (b), Anna Förster (c) , and Samuel Bowong (a)
- **Affiliations**: (a) Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, University of Douala, Cameroon; (b) Université Fédérale de Toulouse, ENIT-LGP, France; (c) University of Bremen, Faculty of Physics and Electrical Engineering, Germany
- **Abstract**: We proposed an intelligent and cost-effective system that allows predicting water quality in outdoor aquaponic systems using machine learning algorithms. This enables farmers in developing countries to monitor water quality in real-time for more sustainable agricultural practices. The system we designed achieved an average prediction accuracy of 98%.

### Analysis of Public Sentiment Regarding COVID-19 Vaccines on the Social Media Reddit
- **Authors**: Lucien Dikla Ngueleo (1) (4), Jules Pagna Disso (2) , Armel Ayimdji Tekemetieu (3) ,Justin Moskolaï Ngossaha (4), and Michael Nana Kameni (1)
- **Affiliations**: (1) African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) AIMS-Cameroon, (2) University of Warwick, (3) McGill University, (4) Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, University of Douala, Cameroon
- **Abstract**: We conducted a study aimed at analyzing the sentiments expressed in Reddit comments about the COVID-19 vaccine and identifying the reasons for public mistrust. We used machine learning algorithms for this analysis. The results of this study could help decision-makers better understand public concerns and improve communication about the vaccine.
